### To use this API:

4. Open the http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

5. Use the textbox on screen to input your sentences seperate by a new line to get sentiment on multiple statements.

6. Hit send and observe the predictions. The output will show json for "prediction" followed by "positive" or "negative" represented in teh order of your input.
