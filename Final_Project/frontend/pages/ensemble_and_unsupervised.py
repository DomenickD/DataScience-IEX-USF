    """
In the world of machine learning, there are different techniques \
    used to make predictions and uncover patterns in data. \
        Today, we're exploring two key concepts:
- **Ensemble Techniques:** Think of it like a group of \
    friends working together to solve a problem. By combining \
        their strengths, they can often find better solutions \
            than any one of them could alone.
- **Unsupervised Techniques:** Imagine trying to organize \
    your photos into groups without any labels. Unsupervised \
        techniques help find patterns in data without \
            knowing the answers in advance.
