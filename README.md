# This is the Offical Repository for the IEX-USF Internship program

**Contents**:
 
- [Titanic](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Titanic). This will display all the machine learning and Neural Networks I currently know as I score models against eachother. 

- [Ames Housing Dataset](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Housing_Regression). This will display a regression solution with different scoring methods than a classification problem.

- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Neural_Networks) This is the MNIST Datset (Hand written numbers) used to train both Pytorch and Tensorflow frameworks. This is a CNN (Image recognition). The streamlit app is a side-by-side comparison of the framework's performances. 

- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/NLP/IMDB_App) This is the IMDB Dataset where there is a Streamlit app that can be accessed (and is fully viewable from the README). It compares PyTorch and Tensorflow and the results of each on the same dataset.

- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Docker_Compose) This is the intro to docker compose used for reference on how to build the backend for a project hosted on Docker Compose. 

- [Final Project](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Final_Project) This is teh Final Project for teh educational portion of the RA Program. Here we see the 3 previous datasets presented in a more non-technical way so all audiences can understand the ideas presented. 

- [Legacy](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Legacy) This is the location for all previous projects that were small or just stepping stones in the RA program that built on larger projects. 

- [Helper Functions](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/blob/main/helper_functions.py) The purpose of this Python file is to provide some commonly used functions to be imported or copied and pasted to any python data science project with the intention of making the process easier. Parameter grids defaults are the primary use right now for hyperparameter tuning.
