# This is the Offical Repository for the IEX-USF Internship program

**Contents**:
 
- [Titanic](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Titanic). This will display all the machine learning and Neural Networks I currently know as I score models against eachother. 

- [Ames Housing Dataset](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Housing_Regression). This will display a regression solution with different scoring methods than a classification problem.

- [Flask API](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Flask_API) This is the FLASK API for Sentiment Analysis. 

- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/NLP/IMDB_App) This is the IMDB Dataset where there is a Streamlit app that can be accessed (and is fully viewable from the README). It compares PyTorch and Tensorflow and the results of each on the same dataset.

- [Flask API](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/tree/main/Flask_API) This is the FLASK API for Sentiment Analysis. 

- [Helper Functions](https://github.com/DomenickD/DataScience-IEX-USF/blob/main/helper_functions.py) The purpose of this Python file is to provide soem commonly used functions to be imported or copied and pasted to any python data science project with the intention of making the process easier.
