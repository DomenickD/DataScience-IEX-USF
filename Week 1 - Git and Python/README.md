#Week 1 Activities Summary

This week, we focused on using Stormwind to complete a python basics/fundamentals course. 
We also focused on learning git, initializing our repositories on github and getting into a habit of using git to interact with github. 

Some key notes: 

- Creating a github repository
- Pushing to our own repository
- Pulling from a public repository
- Branching and Merging
- Collaboration and Version Control
- Markdown basics


Things we will probably get to:

- `git clone`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- Managing large datasets in git
