# Git Command Helper

This easy-to-use graphical interface assists in building common Git commands, providing explanations and quick copy-and-paste functionality.

## Features

* **Command Selection:**  Choose from a dropdown list of essential Git commands (Add, Commit, Push, Pull, etc.).
* **Detail Descriptions:** Gain clear explanations of each command's purpose and functionality.
* **Generated Output:** Automatically generates corresponding shell-executable Git commands ready for copy-and-paste.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Makes constructing and understanding Git commands simple and intuitive.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Run:** Obtain the 'Git Command Helper' program file (Git_Helper.py). Run the program using a suitable execution environment for your file type.

2. **Select Command:** Choose the desired Git command from the dropdown menu.

3. **Enter Details:** Provide any necessary details (e.g., filenames, branch names, or commit messages) in the designated field.

4. **View Output:** The corresponding Git command for execution in your terminal/command prompt will be generated in the 'Output' tab.

5. **Copy and Execute:** Copy the generated command and paste it into your terminal or command prompt to perform the Git action.

## Supported Commands

The following Git commands are currently supported:

* `Add` 
* `Commit`
* `Push`
* `Pull`
* `Branch`
* `Checkout`
* `Merge`
* `Clone`
* `Fetch`
* `Status`
* `Log`

## Requirements

* **Tkinter:** This program uses the Tkinter library for its interface.  Make sure you have Tkinter installed in your environment. (Usually it comes bundled with Python, but you might need to install it separately).

* **Git:** Naturally, you need to have Git installed on your system to execute the generated commands. 

## Notes

* This program simplifies the process of crafting Git commands and is an excellent educational tool. However, it's highly recommended to become familiar with basic Git usage directly on the command line for greater control and flexibility.
